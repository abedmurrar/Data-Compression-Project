# Data and Image Compression ENCS539
# Abed Al Rahman Murrar - 1140155

## Requirements
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [LZW library for python](https://github.com/joeatwork/python-lzw)
* Adaptive arithmetic coding algorithm files are included in this repo, you can find it [here](https://github.com/nayuki/Reference-arithmetic-coding)

### Notice
* Linux OS was used to implement this project
* To start the project using terminal/cmd, run the following commands
1) `cd to/project/path`
2) `python start.py`
* To observe different compression ratios, you can change the text in uncompressed.txt file


## Arithmetic coding
* Creates a new binary file called compressed.bin

## Lempel Ziv
* Creates a new binary file called compressed.lzw

## Results
* Results are viewed on command line that shows compression ratio for each algorithm for the same file
